        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>Pick2Pay</strong> (“Application”), provided by <strong>Aleksandr Shirdin</strong> (“Service Provider”). The Application is offered free of charge and intended for use <em>as is</em>.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Processing</h2>
        <p>The Application does <strong>not collect or transmit any personal data</strong>. All values you enter (e.g., counts, rates, goals) are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> in internal storage. The Application does not use Internet access, analytics, or advertising SDKs. Registration is not required to use the Application. Application data may be included in system-level backups (e.g., Google Drive backup) if such backups are enabled on your device. These backups are managed entirely by your device/operating system provider, not by the Service Provider.

        <h2>Location Information</h2>
        <p>The Application does not collect precise location data.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Since no data are collected or transmitted, <strong>no data are shared</strong> with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        <p>You can delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the Application or clearing its data in your device settings.</p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The Application is not directed to children. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU).</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>All data remain on your device. Please use your device’s built-in security features (such as screen lock or encryption) to protect access.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will appear on this page. Continued use of the Application after an update constitutes consent to the revised Policy.</p>
